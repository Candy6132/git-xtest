1011	"This money comes from residents. They are very grateful."
1012	"You need to enter Dungeon and kill some Larvas. Good luck!"
1013	"Is it done? Take these Antidotes in case you're poisoned."
1014	"Bring me Cherry Wine Recipe from Librarian in Devias Church."
1015	"Nice, I always wanted to make that wine."
1016	"Those monsters are out of controll again. Take care of that."
1017	"Good. I've got some equipment for you. I hope it suits."
1018	"You need to go back to Dungeon and hunt down 20 Ghosts."
1019	"You look like you've seen a ghost. Haha!."
1020	"You need to be stronger. Go and kill 60 Elite Yetis."
1021	"Look at yourself. It's better now, isn't it?"
1022	"Did you like last reward? Get to work and earn another one."
1023	"Here's another piece of equipment, just as I promised."
1024	"Find Ice Queen and kill her. She is a big problem to us."
1025	"At last. Here, I guess you've been looking for this."
1026	"It's time to conquer Lost Tower. Kill some Shadows first."
1027	"You're gonna need better equipment. Here, take this."
1028	"Kill some Cursed Wizards in Lost Tower and find the Robe."
1029	"Ok, you finally made it. Here, take this Bless."
1030	"Can you swim? I hope so. Go kill some monsters in Atlans."
1031	"Ugh, you're soaking wet! Good job whough, take this."
1032	"Make Thunder Liches summon Spirit Knight. I need his weapon."
1033	"Damn, it's broken. We will have to fix it first."
1034	"I need Jewel of Chaos to fix this weapon. Can you bring it?"
1035	"Ok, there you go. Nice, isn't it?"
1036	"We gotta deal with the Dungeon. Go and teach them a lesson!"
1037	"I think I know who's responsible for that mess out there."
1038	"It's the Gordon you have to deal with. I want his head!."
1039	"Is he dead? What a reliefe! You deserve some payoff."
1040	"Did I say Poison Shadows last time? No? Then I say it now."
1041	"You don't look very good. Take this."
1042	"Ok, time for Cows. You shouldn't have problem with them."
1043	"You did it? Good, I've got something for you."
1044	"Devils fly out of Lost Tower during night. Make them fewer."
1045	"I won't make a soup out of it. I'm not a whitch, haha!"
1046	"I guess you know what's next - Death Knight and his sword."
1047	"You beat them, right? Here's another piece of armor."
1048	"Death Gordons are carrying a large axe. I want it."
1049	"You should buy yourself a cart to carry this pile of steel."
1050	"A half men-half horse with a frightening look - find him!"
1051	"I guess it wasn't easy. I've got something extra for you."
1052	"I' ve heard about new phenomenon - Golden Monster. Find it."
1053	"Bizzare thing. Here, have it back."
1054	"Enough of fire? Go back to water and fish me some Bahamuts."
1055	"I think, I know why those Bahamuts are so big..."
1056	"The reason is above the water. Deal with it in Kalima."
1057	"Hmm, I don't think Aegis is what we're looking for."
1058	"Go back to Kalima and keep looking."
1059	"Bingo! Setroids, who could have thought. Good job."
1060	"Need another Bill of Balrog, but this time from Death King."
1061	"I guess it wasn't easy to find. Here, take this."
1062	"Ok, now we can go back to water. Kill some Silver Valkyries."
1063	"Are you freezing? Thowe bustards create a lot of trouble."
1064	"I have the contract for Lizard's Crown. Can you find it?"
1065	"Pretty. 50/50 Zen as usual."
1066	"It's time to deal with Atlans once and for all. Kill Hydra!"
1067	"Great job. Come back to me when you have at least 1 Reset."
1068	"How about I take the box and you take what's inside."
